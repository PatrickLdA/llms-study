      "Question: Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?\n",
      "Reasoning: $1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents\n",
      "He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each\n",
      "If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.\n",
      "Answer: 10\n",

      "Question: Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons. She sold 40% of it yesterday and 1/4 of the remaining today, How many watermelons are left to be sold tomorrow?\n",
      "Reasoning: Ten dozens of watermelons are equal to 10 x 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 watermelons.\n",
      "Yesterday, Alice sold 120 x 40/100 = <<120*40/100=48>>48 watermelons.\n",
      "So, there are only 120 - 48 = <<120-48=72>>72 watermelons left for today.\n",
      "Today, Alice sold 72 x 1/4 = <<72*1/4=18>>18 watermelons.\n",
      "Hence, 72 - 18 = <<72-18=54>>54 watermelons are left to be sold tomorrow.\n",
      "Answer: 54\n",

      "Question: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\n",
      "Reasoning: A single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $<<2*23=46>>46\n",
      "60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $<<46*18=828>>828\n",
      "Answer: 828\n",
